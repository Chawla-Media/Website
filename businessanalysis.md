# Business management requirements
## Business environment
Photo shoots must follow local laws and regulations. Environmental factors include local events which might ask for the 
business service, rapid social media growth, and the use of photography technology including cameras, lights, computers, 
microphones, and other related items. All personnel should be familiar with the environment.
## Mission, goals, and objectives
The business goal is to facilitate the customer experience and broaden the client space. This includes adding a way for 
customers to see available dates and times for photo shoots, see available prints and their prices, and display the company's 
previous work in a visually appealing manner.
## Business model
## Information environment
In the long term, the proposed system should be able to grow with the business as more content is created and potential 
new employees are added. The system's database should keep track of the current print inventory and display available prints 
on the website.
